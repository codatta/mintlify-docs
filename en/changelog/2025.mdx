**Evolving Incentives: Reward Lock-ups for Long-term Ecosystem Management**

<br />

<div style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }}></div>

An optional lock-up feature for rewards from high-incentive tasks (e.g., in Airdrop or Frontier campaigns).

- **Trigger:** Rewards are deposited to your balance after a campaign.
- **Lock:** Secure rewards by locking them in a smart contract via the Assets page.
- **Release:** After the lock-up period, claim rewards directly to your wallet with one click.

This is a key step in evolving our incentive system toward granular management. It provides a tool to manage liquidity in high-reward scenarios, balancing short-term engagement with the ecosystem's long-term health.

**Account System Upgrade: DID Officially Launched**

<br />

<div style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }}></div>

A foundational upgrade enabling account binding to Decentralized Identifiers (DID).

- **Binding:** Self-service integration of an on-chain DID through your next login to Codatta.

- **Lineage:** Enables full traceability and verification of both on-chain and off-chain activities, establishing immutable data provenance.

This deployment establishes the technical cornerstone for a verifiable data economy. By providing each contributor with a persistent, unique digital identity, we enable granular contribution attribution, unambiguous ownership verification, and transparent incentive allocation at the protocol level.
