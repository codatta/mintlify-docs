## Lock-up Rewards for Campaign Payouts

### Feature Release

**Lock-up rewards for campaign payouts are now live:**

* **Scope:** Campaign owners can enable a 3-month (T+90) lock-up rule for rewards from Airdrops, Frontiers and other campaigns.
* **Flow:** Rewards first land in the user's on-platform balance. From the Assets page, users click Lock now to send them into the lock-up contract; once the 3-month period ends, unlocked rewards appear under Lock-up detail and can be claimed to the wallet in one click.
* **Value:** Helps high-reward campaigns reduce instant sell pressure and better reward users who stay in the ecosystem.
