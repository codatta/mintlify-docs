Codatta provides a transparent, immutable visualization of data—from its genesis as a verified asset to its inclusion in larger datasets and final economic utilization.

The **Data Lineage** interface visualizes this lifecycle across four distinct stages.

## Lineage Visualization

The following diagram illustrates the flow of data through the four codified stages of the Codatta protocol.  
In **Stage 1**, the system accepts atomic contributions (samples or labels), builds a **Contribution Fingerprint (CF) record** for each accepted contribution, and then anchors the CF’s fingerprint on-chain.

```

## Lifecycle Stages

### 1. Assetification

The foundational stage where raw contributions are transformed into trusted, immutable assets. This process involves three critical steps tracked by the lineage graph:

- **Submission:** Contributors initiate this stage by providing [samples](https://docs.codatta.io/en/quick-guide/fundamentals#data-basics-for-artificial-intelligence-ai) or [labels](https://docs.codatta.io/en/quick-guide/fundamentals#data-basics-for-artificial-intelligence-ai), along with relevant metadata.
- **Screening & validation:** Codatta runs automatic pre‑scan checks including heuristic-based checks for format, policy compliance, and deduplication, plus semantic checks with AI agents. Where needed, human review is triggered. Submissions that fail at this step are rejected and **never produce a CF**.
- **CF creation & anchoring:** For each accepted atomic contribution, the system builds a **CF commit** (canonicalizing the content hash, attaching evidence & signals, and binding contributor identity), then **anchors the CF’s fingerprint on-chain** (per‑CF or in a batched Merkle root) on the selected network.

For the underlying mechanics, see:

- **[Contribution Fingerprint (CF)](/core-systems/contribution-fingerprint)** – how each atomic contribution becomes a signed, anchored record.

### 2. Data Assembling

In this stage, individual anchored assets are curated and combined to form comprehensive datasets.

- **Composition:** The lineage view visualizes how multiple atomic assets (from Stage 1) flow into a larger "Assembly."
- **Versioning:** Assembling allows for different versions of a dataset (e.g., "Training Set v1.0") to be created from a pool of assets without altering the underlying provenance of the original contributions.

For assembly rules, manifests, and versioning semantics, see **[Data Assembly](/core-concepts/data-assembly)**.

### 3. Publication & Adoption

Once assembled, datasets are released for utility. This stage tracks the downstream reach of the data.

- **Publication:** Visualizes where the dataset has been pushed (e.g., HuggingFace, GitHub, decentralized storage).
- **Adoption:** Tracks commercial or research usage, such as a specific AI model integrating the dataset for training. This node represents the "proof of utility."

For access control and usage metering, see:

- **[Access Control & Metering](/core-concepts/access-control-metering)**
- **[Storage, Compute & Serving](/core-concepts/storage-compute-serving)**

### 4. Payouts

The final stage closes the economic loop. When an adoption event generates revenue (e.g., a licensing fee), it is visualized as a **Payout Event**.

- **Value Flow:** A connection is drawn from the Payout node back to the original **Anchored Assets**.
- **Distribution to Backers:** Funds are distributed to the *current* ownership holders at the time of the payout snapshot.
  - **Initial Owners:** Originally, ownership belongs to the contributors (submitters), validators, and initial stakers.
  - **Backers:** Because fractional ownership is tradable, the current holder may differ from the original creator. The lineage view identifies these current owners as **Backers**—investors or entities who have acquired ownership rights on the open market. The system ensures rewards reach the wallet currently holding the asset fraction.
