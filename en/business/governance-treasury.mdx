description: Policy levers, token sinks and related matters.

### Policy levers

- **Royalty rate bands** by domain and access tier  
- **Default split templates** for contributors, validators, backers, treasury  
- **Access rules** for restricted assets, including KYC, audit level, and dispute windows  
- **Staking parameters**: min stake, lockups, slashing rules  
- **Task launch requirements**: $XNY deposit sizing, refund logic, and priority rules

### Treasury and token sinks

| Flow | Currency | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Submission gas** | $XNY | Deters spam and funds indexing and security operations |
| **Task launch deposit** | $XNY | Reserves network capacity and enforces SLAs |
| **Staking** | $XNY | Confidence signal with slashing for low quality or fraud |
| **Ownership trades** | $XNY | Settlement and listing fees for transfers and bundles |
| **Marketplace fees** | $XNY or stablecoins | If paid in stablecoins, a small $XNY protocol fee still applies |
| **Royalty payouts** | Stablecoins by default | TNPL and usage revenue are shared primarily in stablecoins |

Treasury uses: **audits**, **grants**, **quality bounties**, **tooling for agents and contributors**, and **research**.


### Integration posture

Codatta remains **protocol-first and open**. Integrations include:
- **API connectors** to launch tasks, pull datasets, and run evaluations  
- **On-chain hooks** for metering and settlement with allowlisted bridges  
- **Identity and reputation adapters** to reuse credentials from partner ecosystems
