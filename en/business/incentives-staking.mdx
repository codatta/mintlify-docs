title: Incentives, Reputation & Staking
description: How roles earn, how reputation boosts rewards, and how staking creates confidence.

### Roles and how they earn

| Role | Earns from | Why they matter |
|---|---|---|
| **Contributors** | Royalty share via ownership fractions | Create verified knowledge units |
| **Validators** | Validation fees and royalty share where policy allows | Keep quality high and fraud low |
| **Backers** | Share of owner returns when underwriting cohorts or datasets | Finance data creation and smooth income |
| **Buyers** | Better models, lower upfront cost with TNPL | Demand side of the flywheel |

### Reputation

A transparent score derived from **credentials**, **historical accuracy**, **volume and timeliness**, and **stake behavior**.  
The score maps to a **reward multiplier** with a safe band, for example `0.8x to 1.3x`.

### Staking for confidence

| Stake type | Token | What it does | Slashing signals |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Stake on data** | \$XNY | Acquire or boost ownership fractions of an asset or cohort | Proven inaccuracies, failed audits |
| **Stake on contributor** | $XNY | Back a person or team to lift their reputation multiplier | Systematic low accuracy, fraud, failed KYC escalation |

> Both stake types are **protocol-level**. They secure the network, align incentives, and gate premium tasks.

### Quality controls

- **Randomized checks** against ground truth, adversarial spot audits  
- **AI assisted review** and **facial or KYC escalation** where policy requires  
- **Dispute ladder** with bonded challenges and transparent outcomes
