<Steps>
  <Step title="2026 — Forge (Protocol in Production)">
    Execute the “Forge” year: ship end-to-end hybrid protocol in production (on-chain anchoring -> CF assetification), pilot & PoV (Proof of Value) access control & metering and deterministic royalties, scale pods + useful agents, and enable pay-per-request distribution; see the [Roadmap](/en/community/roadmap) for milestone-level details.
  </Step>

  <Step title="2025 — Tokenization & Commercialization">
    `$XNY` TGE (Jul 23, 2025) and broad circulation via major exchanges (e.g., Binance, Kraken, Bybit, etc.); special thanks to the Binance Booster program (Codatta as the first project) for early distribution and attention; crossed **1M+ KYC’ed users** (the real starting line for enterprise-grade data); used distribution moments to recruit and train contributors (not chase empty metrics); commercial datasets/APIs shipped so contributors earn ongoing royalties.
  </Step>

  <Step title="2024 — Mission Extended to Codatta (General Protocol)">
    Microscope’s mission was extended to build a general protocol for data sourcing, labeling, and on-chain assetification with royalties; staking-as-confidence and contributor reputation were formalized; pilots expanded beyond crypto labels. 
    (Protocol explainer and royalty model).
  </Step>

  <Step title="2023 — Microscope (Cross-Org Public-Goods Launch)">
    Open-source, cross-organization effort to coordinate on-chain account annotation with shared schema, collaborative verification, and multi-party workflows for AML/compliance; co-initiated by Chaintool with near-equal contributions from Coinbase (data team), GoPlus, and engineers from Messari. 
    (Coinbase blog + Microscope docs).
  </Step>
