A curated list of terms used throughout the docs. Each entry links to the page where it is introduced or explained in more depth.

- **Access Control** - Decides who can access which dataset/version and under what conditions ([/core-concepts/access-control-metering](/core-concepts/access-control-metering)).
- **Agreement (Validator Agreement)** - Shows how much validators agree on a claim or label; higher agreement means more trust ([/core-concepts/reputation](/core-concepts/reputation)).
- **Atomic Contribution** - Represents a single piece of work—sample, label, or validation—that we can attribute ([/core-concepts/data-assembly](/core-concepts/data-assembly)).
- **Attribution Snapshot** - Takes a picture of ownership at a moment so we know who gets paid ([/core-concepts/tokenized-ownership-proofs](/core-concepts/tokenized-ownership-proofs)).
- **Backers** - Can purchase ownership fractions to become an owner of a data asset or dataset, or gain fractions by staking on a CF (atomic contribution) to boost its value; they share in owner returns ([/core-concepts/tokenized-ownership-proofs](/core-concepts/tokenized-ownership-proofs)).

- **Contribution Fingerprint (CF)** - Signs and anchors who did what, when, and with what evidence ([/core-concepts/contribution-fingerprint](/core-concepts/contribution-fingerprint)).
- **Contributors** - Add knowledge (people or agents) and earn ownership for accepted work ([/core-concepts/reputation](/core-concepts/reputation)).
- **Cross‑chain Settlement** - Bridges payouts across chains when policy allows ([/core-concepts/royalty-engine](/core-concepts/royalty-engine)).
- **Data Asset** - Bundles CFs into a reusable package you can include in many datasets ([/core-concepts/data-assembly](/core-concepts/data-assembly)).
- **Data Assembly** - Builds versioned datasets from CFs with full provenance and diffs ([/core-concepts/data-assembly](/core-concepts/data-assembly)).
- **Dataset Version** - Freezes a dataset at a point in time; any change makes a new version ([/core-concepts/data-assembly](/core-concepts/data-assembly)).
- **Developer (Task Developer)** - Defines the schema/taxonomy for a task and earns a governed share ([/core-concepts/royalty-engine](/core-concepts/royalty-engine)).
- **TEE** - Lets us transform data without exposing raw content ([Trusted execution environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment); see [/core-concepts/storage-compute-serving](/core-concepts/storage-compute-serving)).
- **Escrow** - Parks ownership until conditions are met, then releases or reverts; payouts adjust accordingly ([/core-concepts/tokenized-ownership-proofs](/core-concepts/tokenized-ownership-proofs)).
- **Evidence & Signals** - Attaches proofs and quality signals that explain why a claim is credible ([/core-concepts/key-concepts](/core-concepts/key-concepts)).
- **Federated Learning** - Trains across data silos; data stays local and only model updates move ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_learning), [McMahan et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629); see [/core-concepts/storage-compute-serving](/core-concepts/storage-compute-serving)).
- **Fractions (Ownership Fractions)** - Acts as transferable shares that represent ownership ([/core-concepts/tokenized-ownership-proofs](/core-concepts/tokenized-ownership-proofs)).
- **Identity** - Represents your wallet/DID/org or agent identity that signs actions and sets policy context ([/core-concepts/identity](/core-concepts/identity)).
- **Lineage** - Shows what’s inside a dataset, why it’s included, and where it came from ([/core-concepts/data-assembly](/core-concepts/data-assembly)).
- **License Modes** - Lets clients choose how to pay: standard, TNPL, or prepaid/credits ([/core-concepts/access-control-metering](/core-concepts/access-control-metering)).
- **Metering** - Records who accessed what, how much, and when so billing and royalties can run ([/core-concepts/access-control-metering](/core-concepts/access-control-metering)).
- **Ownership Liquidity** - Lets owners transfer, bundle, or trade their fractions (experimental/optional) ([/core-concepts/tokenized-ownership-proofs](/core-concepts/tokenized-ownership-proofs)).
- **Ownership Receipt** - Provides a signed proof of what you owned at a given time ([/core-concepts/tokenized-ownership-proofs](/core-concepts/tokenized-ownership-proofs)).
- **Policy (Policy Language)** - Writes access rules in a clear, versioned way and logs every decision ([/core-concepts/access-control-metering](/core-concepts/access-control-metering)).
- **Provenance** - Explains inclusion, exclusion, and origin so audits stay easy ([/core-concepts/data-assembly](/core-concepts/data-assembly)).
- **Rate Limits & Quotas** - Throttles usage to keep costs and performance under control ([/core-concepts/access-control-metering](/core-concepts/access-control-metering)).
- **Reputation** - Provides a multi‑dimensional trust score that routes work and tunes rewards ([/core-concepts/reputation](/core-concepts/reputation)).
- **Revenue Account** - Holds client payments before the system splits, settles, and audits ([/core-concepts/royalty-engine](/core-concepts/royalty-engine)).
- **Royalty Engine** - Turns revenue plus events and ownership into payouts you can replay ([/core-concepts/royalty-engine](/core-concepts/royalty-engine)).
- **Sampling** - Serves small slices for exploration; full access needs higher policy tiers ([/core-concepts/access-control-metering](/core-concepts/access-control-metering)).
- **Secure Serving** - Decrypts and serves only what policy allows, leaving an audit trail ([/core-concepts/storage-compute-serving](/core-concepts/storage-compute-serving)).
- **Serving** - Delivers data and ties every byte back to its CFs and dataset versions ([/core-concepts/storage-compute-serving](/core-concepts/storage-compute-serving)).
- **Storage** - Keeps an immutable source‑of‑truth with fast cloud caches for reads ([/core-concepts/storage-compute-serving](/core-concepts/storage-compute-serving)).
- **Task Developer** - See Developer.
- **TNPL (Train‑Now‑Pay‑Later)** - Lets you use data now and pay later from revenue; the system tracks the obligation ([/core-concepts/access-control-metering](/core-concepts/access-control-metering)).
- **Token Utility (XNY)** - Powers protocol operations and sustainability: gas payments, staking, task launches, access, ownership exchange, and governance fees ([/protocol-token/token-utility](/protocol-token/token-utility)).
- **Transfer** - Move fractions between identities or into/out of escrow ([/core-concepts/tokenized-ownership-proofs](/core-concepts/tokenized-ownership-proofs)).
- **Treasury Share** - Governed slice for protocol sustainability and community ([/core-concepts/royalty-engine](/core-concepts/royalty-engine)).
- **Valuation Configuration** - Versioned inputs that derive effective price/weight ([/core-concepts/royalty-engine](/core-concepts/royalty-engine)).
- **Validators** - Verify quality; influence inclusion/weighting; may share royalties ([/core-concepts/reputation](/core-concepts/reputation)).
- **Versioning** - Any rule/input change produces a new dataset version ([/core-concepts/data-assembly](/core-concepts/data-assembly)).
- **XNY (Protocol Token)** - Codatta’s native token that fuels the network and aligns incentives—used for gas, staking, task launches, access, and ownership exchanges; designed to support long‑term sustainability ([token info](/protocol-token/token-info), [tokenomics](/protocol-token/tokenomics)).
