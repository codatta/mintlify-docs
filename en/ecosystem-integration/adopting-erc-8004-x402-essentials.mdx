## Overview

![Flow of contributors, 8004 agents, asset assembly and x402 payouts](/en/diagrams/erc-8004-x402-flow.png)

Codatta turns human and agent work into on-chain data assets, then routes value back to whoever created that value.  
To plug cleanly into the emerging agent economy, we standardize on:

- **ERC-8004** for agent identity and trust on Ethereum
- **x402** for HTTP-native, pay-per-request payments


## 1. Background

**ERC-8004 (Trustless Agents)** is an Ethereum standard that adds a trust layer on top of agent protocols.  
It defines three on-chain registries—Identity, Reputation, and Validation—so agents can be discovered and judged by a shared record of their behavior ([Ethereum Improvement Proposals][1]).

**x402** is an open, chain-agnostic payment protocol that reuses the HTTP `402 Payment Required` status code so clients (humans or AI agents) can pay for APIs and content directly over HTTP with crypto, typically stablecoins ([Coinbase Developer Docs][2]).


## 2. How we adopt ERC-8004

In Codatta, agents help with pre-labelling, triage, and validation alongside human experts.

We use ERC-8004 to make these agents first-class, verifiable participants:

- **Agent registration**  
  Each Codatta agent (for example “transaction classifier”, “KYB triage”, “policy validator”) is listed in the ERC-8004 Identity Registry with:
  - its MCP/A2A endpoint
  - capability description
  - basic pricing metadata

- **On-chain reputation and validation**  
  As agents pre-label and validate tasks, we emit:
  - **Reputation entries** summarizing outcomes (accept rate, conflicts with humans, slashing events)
  - **Validation entries** pointing to off-chain logs or evaluation reports via URIs ([Composable Security][3])

- **Link to data ownership**  
  For each job, our internal systems record which data portfolios and contributors were involved.  
  ERC-8004 events include references to those IDs in their evidence fields; our indexers then map agent activity to:
  - which data assets were used
  - which humans and agent operators should share future revenue ([Medium][4])

Result: consumers can see not just “Codatta labels”, but *which* agents produced them and how those agents have behaved over time, while we preserve a precise link back to human and on-chain ownership.


## 3. How we adopt x402

We use x402 as the payment rail for Codatta APIs and agent endpoints.

### Pay-per-use access

Any paid Codatta endpoint (for example, “label this batch”, “score this transaction”, “fetch this dataset slice”) follows the x402 flow:

1. Client calls the endpoint.
2. If payment is required, we return `402 Payment Required` plus an x402 payment description (amount, currency, destination, expiry) ([Coinbase Developer Docs][5]).
3. The client (human app or AI agent) pays and retries the request with the x402 authorization header.

This gives us **fine-grained, per-request monetization** without separate billing systems or complex API key management.

### From revenue to rewards

Once a payment settles to Codatta:

- We attribute the call to:
  - the data portfolios used, and
  - the agents and humans who contributed to them.
- Revenue is split according to our staking and ownership rules and streamed out as **micro-payouts** to contributors and agent operators, with the remainder going to the protocol treasury ([Coinbase Developer Docs][2]).

Because x402 is designed for low-friction, on-chain payments, these payouts can be frequent and small rather than batched.


## 4. Putting it together

- **ERC-8004** turns Codatta agents into **discoverable, auditable actors** with shared identity and trust signals.
- **x402** turns each API or agent call into a **programmable payment event**, which we route back through Codatta’s ownership graph.

Together, they let Codatta plug into a broader agent economy while staying true to our core promise: when your data and expertise power AI, you get a verifiable share of the upside.
